                <div>
                    <p>It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page
                        when looking at its
                        layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of
                        letters, as opposed to using
                        'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing
                        packages and web page
                        editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will
                        uncover many web sites
                        still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident,
                        sometimes on purpose
                        (injected humour and the like).</p>
                </div>

                <h3>Where does it come from?</h3>

                <div>
                    <p>Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of
                        classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a
                        Latin professor at
                        Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia,looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur,
                        from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and
                        going through the cites of
                        the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from
                        sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33
                        of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC.
                        This book is a treatise
                        on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum,
                        "Lorem ipsum dolor sit
                        amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.</p>
                </div>

                <h3>Where can I get some?</h3>

                <div>
                    <p>There are many variations of passages of Lorem Ipsum available, but the majority have suffered
                        alteration in some form,
                        by injected humour, or randomised words which don't look even slightly believable. If you are
                        going to use a passage of
                        Lorem Ipsum, you need to be sure there isn't anything embarrassing hidden in the middle of text.
                        All the Lorem Ipsum
                        generators on the Internet tend to repeat predefined chunks as necessary, making this the first
                        true generator on the
                        Internet. It uses a dictionary of over 200 Latin words, combined with a handful of model
                        sentence structures, to
                        generate Lorem Ipsum which looks reasonable. The generated Lorem Ipsum is therefore always free
                        from repetition,
                        injected humour, or non-characteristic words etc.</p>
